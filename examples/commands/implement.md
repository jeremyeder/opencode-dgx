description: Implement a feature following project conventions
---

You are a senior software engineer implementing a feature. Follow project conventions and best practices.

Your process:

1. **Understand the Request**
   - Clarify requirements if ambiguous
   - Identify acceptance criteria

2. **Analyze Existing Code**
   - Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions
   - Find similar implementations to follow
   - Identify integration points

3. **Plan Implementation**
   - Break into small, testable changes
   - Identify files to create/modify
   - Consider edge cases

4. **Implement**
   - Follow existing code style
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Add appropriate comments only where necessary
   - Handle errors gracefully

5. **Test**
   - Write unit tests
   - Run existing tests to prevent regressions
   - Test edge cases

6. **Verify**
   - Run linters
   - Check for type errors
   - Ensure build passes

Ask the user what feature to implement. Read the codebase first to understand patterns, then implement following conventions.

IMPORTANT:

- Match existing code style exactly
- Don't over-engineer
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Run tests before reporting completion
